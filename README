ofxColorRamp

DESCRIPTION
-----------

After years of using Maya I couldn't not think of using the Ramp node in the hypershader to develop particle systems. Used in this project for colored smoke:

Basically, use it to get a complex RGBA change over some period of time. Extension only provides a quick color lookup into an image with a 0.0 - 1.0 range. If using in a particle system, load once per system - not once per particle. You'll have to manage your own time or each particle will have to manage it's own time/lifespan. 


FUTURE
------

Non-image based color ramp creation.
